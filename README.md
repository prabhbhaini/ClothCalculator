# Customer Rewards Calculator

## Project Description

The **Customer Rewards Calculator** is a web-based tool that calculates the rewards a customer has earned based on their purchase. The application allows users to input their customer information, the total cost of clothing and accessories, and any rewards they have already received. It calculates the total rewards based on the total purchase and provides a summary of the pending rewards.

The calculator uses a tiered rewards system:
- **10% reward** for total purchases under $2500
- **15% reward** for total purchases between $2500 and $4000
- **20% reward** for total purchases over $4000

This tool helps users keep track of their earned rewards and understand how much more they could potentially earn.

## Features

- Input customer information including name, email, and customer number.
- Enter the total cost of clothing and accessories purchased.
- Enter the amount of rewards already received.
