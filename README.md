# Customer Rewards Calculator

## Project Description

The **Customer Rewards Calculator** is a web-based tool that calculates the rewards a customer has earned based on their purchase. The application allows users to input their customer information, the total cost of clothing and accessories, and any rewards they have already received. It calculates the total rewards based on the total purchase and provides a summary of the pending rewards.

The calculator uses a tiered rewards system:
- **10% reward** for total purchases under $2500
- **15% reward** for total purchases between $2500 and $4000
- **20% reward** for total purchases over $4000

This tool helps users keep track of their earned rewards and understand how much more they could potentially earn.

## Features

- Input customer information including name, email, and customer number.
- Enter the total cost of clothing and accessories purchased.
- Enter the amount of rewards already received.
- Calculate and display the total rewards based on the purchase amount.
- Show the pending rewards if any.

## License Explanation

I have chosen the **MIT License** for this project because it is a permissive open-source license. This means that anyone can freely use, modify, and distribute the code, even for commercial purposes, as long as they include the original license in any distributed versions of the code. The MIT License is one of the most commonly used licenses for open-source software, as it provides a good balance between freedom for users and legal protection for the author.

## Enhancements
**Add a Progress Bar for Calculating Rewards**
   - **Description**: Currently, when the user submits the form to calculate the rewards, there is no indication of the process happening in the background. We plan to add a **progress bar** or **loading spinner** to provide users with feedback while the form is being processed.
   - **Expected Outcome**: A visual indicator will be shown while the calculation is happening, and it will disappear once the results are displayed.
