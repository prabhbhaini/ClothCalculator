### Features:
- **Customer Info Input**: Collects customer name, email, and a unique customer number.
- **Cost Calculation**: Calculates the total cost of clothing and accessories.
- **Rewards Calculation**: Calculates the total rewards based on the purchase amount, using different reward rates.
- **Pending Rewards**: Shows the remaining rewards yet to be received by the customer.

## Enhancements 
**Add a Progress Bar for Calculating Rewards**
   - **Description**: Currently, when the user submits the form to calculate the rewards, there is no indication of the process happening in the background. We plan to add a **progress bar** or **loading spinner** to provide users with feedback while the form is being processed.
   - **Expected Outcome**: A visual indicator will be shown while the calculation is happening, and it will disappear once the results are displayed
